# Personal Project - Drumbi

## About

### Inspirations

- Yogev Gabay's youtube explainers: [sub-division stuff](https://youtu.be/lDfnhmfD3DU?t=115), [tracks with different bar lengths](https://youtu.be/lDfnhmfD3DU?t=395)
- [Modalic's Beat Scholar](https://www.modalics.com/beatscholar), similar vibes to Yogev's stuff
- [Other drum machines, there's tonnes of them](https://www.ordrumbox.com/)

### Tech Stack

- JavaScript / React
- TailWindCSS

### Why Stack

- React is what I'm practised in
- The instructions said not to use TypeScript ðŸ˜­
- I like using TailWind

### What I enjoyed

- From the real thing:
  - TODO:
